# Problem 1

Load dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Description of dataset:

The `early_january_weather` dataset represents hourly meteorological
data from weather station in EWR from January 1-15, 2013. The dataset
has 358 observations and 15 variables.

The variables include day, dewp, hour, humid, month, origin, precip,
pressure, temp, time_hour, visib, wind_dir, wind_gust, wind_speed, year.
Variables `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour` represent the time of
recording. Variable `time_hour` represents the date and hour of the
recording as a POSIXct date. Variable `humid` represents the relative
humidity, with an average of 65.48 (Range: 32.86-100). Variable
`wind_dir` represents wind direction in degrees, with an average of
208.19 degrees (Range: 0-360 degrees). `wind_speed`, and `wind_gust`
represents the wind speed and gust speed in mph, with an average of 8
mph (Range: 0-24.17 mph) and 22.53 mph (Range: 16-31 mph) respectively.
Variable `precip` represents precipitation in inches, with an average of
0.0020391 inches (Range: 0-0.19 inches). Variable `pressure` represents
sea level pressure in millibars, with an average of 1022.52 millibars
(Range: 1010.8-1034.4 millibars). Variable `visib` represents visibility
in miles, with an average of 8.52 miles (Range: 0.12-10 miles). Variable
`dewp` represents the dewpoint in F, with an average of 28.06 F (Range:
8.96-53.06 F). Variable `temp` represents the temperature in F. The mean
temperature is 39.58 F (Range: 24.08-57.92 F).

Scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x)

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Although the temperature fluctuates within each day, on average, as the
date and time increases, the temperature increases. The temperature
decreased dramatically after January 14. While the humidity started out
low on January 1st, the humidity slightly increased starting January 6
on average. However, there is a huge increase in both temperature and
humidity starting January 12.

Save scatterplot to project directory

``` r
ggsave("prob_1scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

Create a dataframe

``` r
prob2_df <-
  tibble(
    numeric_samp = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = numeric_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    vec_factor = factor(rep(c("a", "b", "c"), length.out = 10))
  )
```

Mean of numeric_samp

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, numeric_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.125928

Mean of greater_0

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, greater_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

Mean of vec_char

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Mean of vec_factor

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The random sample of size 10 from a standard normal distribution
produced a mean. The logical vector was also able to produce a mean, but
the mean doesn’t make sense because of the bolean values (TRUE and
FALSE). The character vector and factor vector was not able to produce a
value for a mean.

Convert greater_0, vec_char, and vec_factor to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, greater_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor))
```

as.numeric function converts previous logical, character, and factor
variables into numeric variables. When as.numeric function is applied to
the logical vector, it is able to successfully convert the values in the
vector into a numeric values. This occurs because the values in the
logical vector (0 and 1) are numbers that represent TRUE and FALSE.
However, the values of 0 and 1 represent boolean values and don’t hold
additional meaning, so it does not make sense to take the mean of the
logical vector, even if it’s converted to a numeric vector and error
message doesn’t show when calculating the mean.

When as.numeric function is applied to the character vector, an error
message will show. This is because the values in the vector resemble a
character, not a number. You cannot assign numbers to characters. This
does make sense when I am trying to take the mean, since you cannot take
a mean that are not numbers.

When as.numeric function is applied to the factor vector, it is able to
successfully convert the values in the vector into a numeric values.
This occurs because the values in the factor vector (1, 2, and 3) are
actual numbers. However, since the represent the factor levels within
the vector, they do not hold additional meaning. Therefore, calculating
the mean of this variable does not make sense, even if is converted to a
numeric vector and an error message doesn’t show when calculating the
mean.
