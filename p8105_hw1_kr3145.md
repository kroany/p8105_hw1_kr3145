# Problem 1

Load dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Description of dataset:

The `early_january_weather` dataset represents hourly meteorological
data from weather station in EWR from January 1- 15, 2013. The dataset
has 358 observations and 15 variables.

The variables include day, dewp, hour, humid, month, origin, precip,
pressure, temp, time_hour, visib, wind_dir, wind_gust, wind_speed, year.
Variables `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour` represent the time of
recording. Variable `time_hour` represents the date and hour of the
recording as a POSIXct date. Variable `humid` represents the relative
humidity, with an average of 65.48 (Range: 32.86- 100). Variable
`wind_dir` represents wind direction in degrees, with an average of
208.19 degrees (Range: 0- 360 degrees). `wind_speed` and `wind_gust`
represents the wind speed and gust speed in mph, with an average of 8
mph (Range: 0- 24.17 mph) and 22.53 mph (Range: 16- 31 mph)
respectively. Variable `precip` represents precipitation in inches, with
an average of 0.0020391 inches (Range: 0-0.19 inches). Variable
`pressure` represents sea level pressure in millibars, with an average
of 1022.52 millibars (Range: 1010.8- 1034.4 millibars). Variable `visib`
represents visibility in miles, with an average of 8.52 miles (Range:
0.12-10 miles). Variable `dewp` represents the dewpoint in F, with an
average of 28.06 F (Range: 8.96-53.06 F). Variable `temp` represents the
temperature in F. The mean temperature is 39.58 F (Range: 24.08-57.92
F).

Scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x), with color points indicating
humid

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Although the temperature fluctuates within each day, on average, as the
date and time increases, the temperature increases. The temperature
decreased dramatically after January 14. While the humidity started out
low on January 1st, the humidity slightly increased starting January 6
on average. However, there is a huge increase in both temperature and
humidity starting January 12.

Save scatterplot to project directory

``` r
ggsave("prob_1scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

Create a dataframe

``` r
prob2_df <-
  tibble(
    numeric_samp = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = numeric_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    vec_factor = factor(rep(c("a", "b", "c"), length.out = 10))
  )
```

Mean of numeric_samp

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, numeric_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.1823517

Mean of greater_0

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, greater_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

Mean of vec_char

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Mean of vec_factor

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The random sample of size 10 from a standard normal distribution and the
logical vector produced a mean. The character vector and factor vector
did not produce a mean. It resulted in NA, and a warning message
appeared.

Convert greater_0, vec_char, and vec_factor to numeric vectors

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, greater_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor))
```

as.numeric function attempts to convert previous logical, character, and
factor vectors into numeric vectors.

When as.numeric function is applied to the logical vector, it is able to
successfully convert the values in the vector into numeric values. This
occurs because the values in the logical vector (0 and 1) are internally
stored as numbers that represent TRUE and FALSE. This helps explain what
happens when calculating the mean, because it will calculate the mean
based on the 0’s and 1’s in the vector.

When as.numeric function is applied to this character vector, an error
message will show. This is because the values in the vector hold
non-numeric characters, so the conversion is not successful. This does
explain what happens when I try to take the mean. Since you cannot take
a mean of characters, a warning message will appear and will result in
NA.

When as.numeric function is applied to the factor vector, it is able to
successfully convert the values in the vector into a numeric values.
This occurs because the underlying values in the factor vector (1, 2,
and 3) are numbers that represent factor levels. However, these values
don’t hold any meaning. Therefore, calculating the mean of this variable
does not make sense, even if the conversion and calculation is
successful.
