# Problem 1

Load dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Description of dataset:

The dataset has 358 observations and 15 variables. The variables in the
dataset include day, dewp, hour, humid, month, origin, precip, pressure,
temp, time_hour, visib, wind_dir, wind_gust, wind_speed, year.

pull(early_january_weather, origin)

The data represents hourly meterological data from weather station in
EWR from January 1 to January 15, 2013.

The average humidity is 65.48 with a range of between 32.86 and 100. The
average precipitation is 0.0020391 inches with a range between 0 inches
and 0.19 inches. The average dewpoint is 28.06 F with a range of between
8.96 F and 53.06 F. The mean temperature is 39.58 F with a range between
24.08 F and 57.92 F.

Scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x)

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

Although the temperature does fluctuate within each day, on average, as
the date and time increases, the temperature increases. The temperature
decreased dramatically after January 14. While the humidity started out
low on January 1st, the humidity slightly increased starting January 6
on average. However, there is a huge increase in both temperature and
humidity starting January 12.

Save scatterplot to project directory

``` r
ggsave("prob_1scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

Create a dataframe ????check character and factor vector

``` r
prob2_df <-
  tibble(
    numeric_samp = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = numeric_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c", "a"))
  )
```

Mean of numeric_samp

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, numeric_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.1533074

Mean of greater_0

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, greater_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

Mean of vec_char

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Mean of vec_factor

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The random sample of size 10 from a standard normal distribution
produced a mean. The logical vector was also able to produce a mean, but
the mean doesn’t make sense because of the bolean values (TRUE and
FALSE). The character vector and factor vector was not able to produce a
value for a mean.

Convert greater_0, vec_char, and vec_factor to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, greater_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor))
```

as.numeric function converts previous logical, character, and factor
variables into numeric variables. When as.numeric function is applied to
the logical vector, it is able to successfully convert the values in the
vector into a numeric values. This occurs because the values in the
logical vector (0 and 1) are numbers that represent TRUE and FALSE.
However, the values of 0 and 1 represent boolean values and don’t hold
additional meaning, so it does not make sense to take the mean of the
logical vector, even if it’s converted to a numeric vector and error
message doesn’t show when calculating the mean.

When as.numeric function is applied to the character vector, an error
message will show. This is because the values in the vector resemble a
character, not a number. You cannot assign numbers to characters. This
does make sense when I am trying to take the mean, since you cannot take
a mean that are not numbers.

When as.numeric function is applied to the factor vector, it is able to
successfully convert the values in the vector into a numeric values.
This occurs because the values in the factor vector (1, 2, and 3) are
actual numbers. However, since the represent the factor levels within
the vector, they do not hold additional meaning. Therefore, calculating
the mean of this variable does not make sense, even if is converted to a
numeric vector and an error message doesn’t show when calculating the
mean.
