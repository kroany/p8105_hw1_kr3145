# Problem 1

Load dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Description of dataset:

The dataset has 358 observations and 15 variables. The variables in the
dataset include day, dewp, hour, humid, month, origin, precip, pressure,
temp, time_hour, visib, wind_dir, wind_gust, wind_speed, year.

The data represents hourly meterological data from weather station in
EWR from January 1 to January 15, 2013.

The average humidity is 65.48 with a range of between 32.86 and 100. The
average precipitation is 0.0020391 inches with a range between 0 inches
and 0.19 inches. The average dewpoint is 28.06 F with a range of between
8.96 F and 53.06 F. The mean temperature is 39.58 F with a range between
24.08 F and 57.92 F.

Scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x)

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

Although the temperature does fluctuate within each day, on average, as
the date and time increases, the temperature increases. The temperature
decreased dramatically after January 14. While the humidity started out
low on January 1st, the humidity slightly increased starting January 6
on average. However, there is a huge increase in both temperature and
humidity starting January 12.

Save scatterplot to project directory

``` r
ggsave("prob_1scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```
